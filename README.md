Estimation of Breathing Rate with Confidence Interval Using Single Channel CW Radar


Breathing rate estimation using a single channel CW radar is proposed by including confidence intervals. To this end, time-varying
dominant Doppler frequency of radar signal is extracted in time-frequency domain. The sum of these unwanted components is extracted in time-frequency domain and from their surrogate versions, bootstrap resamples of the measured signal are obtained. A 95% confidence interval is calculated for breathing rate estimation using the bootstrap approach.
